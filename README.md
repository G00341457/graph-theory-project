# graph-theory-project

This is my 3rd year project for graph theory. The object is to construct a non deterministic finite automata
in the Go programming language. 

To run my project:
first clone it from my github account G00341457.
Then using the command terminal navigate into the folder where you have extracted my code.
run the command go run project.go

I found a number of areas in this project to be tricky as there was a number of data structures used which I did not have previous knowledge of. Also using the Go language was another learning curve as while I do feel I will use it in the future, before this project I had a very basic understanding of it.
